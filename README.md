### Introduction ###

CSP Solver is a package to allow efficient solving of any Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs) implemented following
the CSP interface given in the CSP module. The package contains simple backtracking, backtracking with forward checking,
backtracking with arc consistency, and backtracking with arc consistency and forward checking (AC-3). The package also 
contains several heuristics to improve the efficiency of the search algorithms (see section: heuristics).
